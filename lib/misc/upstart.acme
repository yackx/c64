; BASIC upstart
;
; This routine emits the folllowing BASIC program:
;
;   2012 SYS2061
;
; that will execute the asm code right after this source inclusion.
;
; Example:
;
;      !src <common/basic-upstart.acme>
;      main:
;      lda #0
;      sta $d020
;      rts
;
; To run the program, simply issue the `RUN` command from BASIC.
; The Makefile configures the emulator to autoload the program at startup,
; so it will be executed right after `make TARGET=foo/bar run` without
; further action.
