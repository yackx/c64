# Assemblers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository uses ACME.

Assemblers come in different flavors. Find out which one best suits your taste. Not one is "perfect". Syntax is not compatible between assemblers but you may find conversion scripts.

- [KickAssembler](http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/) - Java-based. Very good documentation. Feels like... Java.
- [dasm](https://dasm-assembler.github.io/) - Strong and classic asm feel, but lacks convenience.
- [ACME](https://github.com/meonwax/acme) - High level C-like syntax. Nice to use. Documentation a bit confusing.
- [cc65](https://www.cc65.org/) - Unmaintained.
