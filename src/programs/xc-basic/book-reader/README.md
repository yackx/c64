# Book reader

**A simple book reader**

## Build

Adjust the variables in `build_book.py` and run `make book` to build the book from a text file to a series of screen code files.

The files are already included in the repository so this step is not necessary if you are running the program with the provided book.

```bash
book-reader $ make book
```

## Run

From this directory, run:

```bash
book-reader $ make run
```

## asm version

An asm version of the book reader is available [here](/src/programs/book-reader).
