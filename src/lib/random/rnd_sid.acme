; SID random number seed
;
; Usage:
; - Call
;
; The SID chip is often used to generate random numbers.
; The randomness properties are poor however but could be sufficient
; for places where speed is of the essence.
;
; It can however be used as a seed for a PRNG.
;
; NOT SUITABLE FOR USE WITH EMULATOR
; NOT TESTED ON REAL HARDWARE

; Generate random numbers using SID
;
; Usage:
; - Call rnd_sid once to seed the PRNG (discard the result)
; - Get $d41b to obtain a random value
init_rnd_sid:
            LDA #$FF                        ; maximum frequency value
            STA $D40E                       ; voice 3 frequency low byte
            STA $D40F                       ; voice 3 frequency high byte
            LDA #$80                        ; noise waveform, gate bit off
            STA $D412                       ; voice 3 control register
            lda $d41b                       ; random values appear in location $D41B
                                            ; DISCARD on first call
            RTS
